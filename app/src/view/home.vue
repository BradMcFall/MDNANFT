    <div class="content">Welcome to OnChainDNA.  Your DNA information is potentially infinitely copyable.  This allows scientists to imagine experimenting with it in innumerable ways and medical researchers to actually nurture new forms of health care. It also however has resulted in what appears as abrogation of personal rights when DNA sequencing companies create business plans to sell that information in contracts that do not take security and privacy of this abundant human resource seriously enough.   Avalancheavax, a blockchain platform developed by AvaLabs, designed a format that permits small amounts of arbitrary data to be attached to itâ€™s  transactions secured by their native token $AVAX. OpenChainDNA is a demonstration project to showcase this functionality as a foundation towards creating a consortium of DNA blockchain companies that seek to ethically and legally constitute a marketplace to  transact the buying and selling of private DNA sequence smart contract information for the improvement of the health and well-being of everyone.
