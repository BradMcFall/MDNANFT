With the cost to sequence DNA dropping precipitously over the past decade many people have chosen to have their genomes sequenced either out of curiosity, to learn more about their genetic heritage, or to help further the development of personalized medicine.  The sale of large amounts of sequence data from sequencing companies to big pharma beyond the oversight of the individuals from whom the data was obtained has led to the rise of  over a dozen DNA blockchain companies that seek to give control of DNA sequence data back to the consumer without sacrificing the use of it for research and development both in medicine and science.  Various business models have been established to decentralize and distribute this control but because cryptocurrency blockchain protocols have largely been established around the same basic model – one coin – one function each of these solutions offers little to differentiatie itself from the others.  This is leading to a recentralization of control around those companies that  are attempting gain the most users.  The arrival of the new consensus protocol family provided by avalancheavax promies to change this past developmental  cryptocurrency trend by permitting diverse blockchains to transact and interoperate in ways that permit new econonomc structures to arise out of interoperation when the user base is shared.  This project presents the encoding and sale of disease associated DNA sequences via non fungible tokens and is the first step in the formation of a consortium of DNA blockchains that can share give their users control , shared and  aggregated into aspects that create collatoroal ization for loans.</div>
